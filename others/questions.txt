Q: What are the flash points of ammonia and benzene, and which one is more flammable based on this property?
A: Ammonia has no available flash point listed in its SDS, while benzene has a flash point of < -11°C / 12°F. Based on flash point, benzene is more flammable as its extremely low flash point indicates it can ignite at very low temperatures.

Q: Compare the health hazard ratings in the NFPA diamond for both chemicals and explain what these ratings mean for worker safety.
A: Ammonia has a health hazard rating of 3 in the NFPA diamond, while benzene has a rating of 2. The higher rating for ammonia (3) indicates it poses a more serious acute health hazard than benzene (2). A rating of 3 means the material can cause serious or permanent injury upon short exposure, while a rating of 2 indicates materials that can cause temporary incapacitation or residual injury.

Q: What personal protective equipment (PPE) is recommended when handling both ammonia and benzene? List the similarities and differences.
A: Both chemicals require similar PPE: protective gloves, eye protection, protective clothing, and appropriate respiratory protection. For both, chemical-resistant gloves and tight-sealing safety goggles are specifically mentioned. The main difference is that benzene's SDS specifically mentions anti-static boots and clothing due to its flammability hazards, while ammonia emphasizes equipment rated for cylinder pressure since it's stored as a compressed gas.

Q: Both ammonia and benzene have aquatic toxicity concerns. Compare their environmental hazards and spill response requirements.
A: Both chemicals are toxic to aquatic life. Ammonia is classified as "very toxic to aquatic life" (Category 1) while benzene is "toxic to aquatic life with long-lasting effects." For spill response, both require stopping leaks if safe to do so, using spark-proof tools, preventing entry to waterways, collecting spillage, and notifying authorities if environmental contamination occurs. Ammonia specifically mentions using water spray to reduce vapors, while benzene mentions using absorbent materials and vapor-suppressing foam.

Q: What are the exposure limits for ammonia according to ACGIH TLV, and how do these compare to OSHA PEL values?
A: According to ACGIH TLV, ammonia has a TWA of 25 ppm (17 mg/m³) for 8 hours and a STEL of 35 ppm (24 mg/m³) for 15 minutes. The OSHA PEL lists a TWA of 50 ppm (35 mg/m³) for 8 hours. This means the ACGIH recommended limits are more stringent than the OSHA regulatory requirements.

Q: Both chemicals are carcinogenic, mutagenic, or have reproductive concerns. Detail the specific classifications for each and any warnings related to these hazards.
A: Benzene is classified as carcinogenic (Category 1A) and mutagenic (Category 1B). It's listed by IARC as Group 1 (carcinogenic to humans), by ACGIH as A1, and is a known carcinogen according to NTP and OSHA. California Proposition 65 lists benzene as a carcinogen, developmental hazard, and male reproductive toxin. Ammonia, in contrast, is not classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic, or having reproductive toxicity according to its SDS, which states "no known significant effects or critical hazards" for these categories.

Q: What first aid measures are recommended for eye contact with ammonia versus benzene? Why might these differ?
A: For ammonia: Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 10 minutes, remove contact lenses, get immediate medical attention, and note that chemical burns must be treated promptly by a physician. For benzene: Rinse immediately with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes, keep eye wide open while rinsing, don't rub affected area, remove contact lenses, and get medical attention if irritation persists. The measures differ because ammonia causes severe corrosive damage (Category 1) requiring immediate medical treatment, while benzene causes serious eye irritation (Category 2) which may be less immediately damaging but still requires thorough rinsing.


Q: Both chemicals have specific storage requirements. What temperature and ventilation conditions should be maintained for each, and what materials or conditions should be avoided?
A: Both chemicals should be stored in cool, dry, well-ventilated areas away from heat, ignition sources, and direct sunlight. For ammonia, cylinders should be stored upright with valve protection caps in place, and temperatures should not exceed 52°C (125°F). For benzene, no specific temperature limit is given, but it should be kept away from oxidizers. Both should be kept away from incompatible materials - for ammonia, these are oxidizers and yellow metals (brass & copper); for benzene, these are strong acids, strong bases, and strong oxidizing agents. Both require grounding of containers and equipment to prevent static discharge.
