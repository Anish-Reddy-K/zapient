The document notes that the time to breakthrough for glove material varies by manufacturer and for mixtures, the protection time cannot be accurately estimated.\n* **Respiratory protection:**  A respirator that meets the appropriate standards should be selected based on the hazard and potential for exposure. In situations with high concentrations or poor ventilation, a full-face respirator may be necessary.\n* **Body protection:**  Personal protective equipment for the body should be chosen based on the task and risks involved and approved by a specialist before handling the product.\n* **Footwear:** Appropriate footwear is also recommended.\n\nThe document strongly advises following a risk assessment to determine the appropriate level of protection and getting specialist approval for specific PPE choices.",
