          "content": "## Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for Ammonia and Benzene\n\nHandling ammonia and benzene requires specific PPE to protect against their hazards.  The exact PPE will depend on the task and risk assessment but generally includes:\n\n**Ammonia:**\n\n*   **Respiratory protection:** Select a respirator appropriate for the hazard and potential exposure, meeting approved standards.  A full-face respirator might be necessary in certain situations.\n*   **Hand protection:**  Chemical-resistant, impervious gloves complying with an approved standard are essential. Regularly check glove integrity during use.\n*   **Eye protection:** Safety goggles or a face shield are necessary to protect against eye damage.\n*   **Skin and body protection:** Appropriate footwear and additional skin protection (e.g., coveralls) should be chosen based on the task and approved by a specialist. \n*   **Other:**  Use spark-proof tools and explosion-proof equipment.  Avoid breathing gas and ensure adequate ventilation.\n\n**Benzene:**\n\n*   **Eye/face protection:** Tight-sealing safety goggles are recommended.\n*   **Hand protection:** Wear suitable, impervious gloves.\n*   **Skin and body protection:** Wear suitable protective clothing, such as long-sleeved clothing, and chemical-resistant garments.\n*   **Other:** Use grounding and bonding connections during transfer to prevent static discharge. Ensure adequate ventilation and use spark-proof and explosion-proof equipment. Avoid skin, eye, and clothing contact.  Do not eat, drink, or smoke while handling.\n\n**General Precautions for Both:**\n\n*   Always follow safety data sheets (SDS) instructions before handling either substance.\n*   Ensure adequate ventilation and avoid contact with skin and eyes. \n*   Wash hands thoroughly before breaks and after handling.
