          "content": "# Safety Measures for Handling Ammonia\n\nBased on the provided safety data sheet, here's a summary of safety measures to follow when handling ammonia:\n\n## Handling Precautions\n\n*   **Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):** Always wear appropriate PPE, including chemical-resistant gloves, eye/face protection, and protective clothing.  Select PPE based on the task and risk assessment, and ensure it's approved by a specialist.\n*   **Respiratory Protection:** Use a respirator that meets the appropriate standard based on the hazard and potential exposure. A full-face respirator might be necessary in certain circumstances.\n*   **Hygiene:** Wash hands, forearms, and face thoroughly after handling, before eating, smoking, using the restroom, and at the end of the workday.  Use proper techniques to remove contaminated clothing and wash it thoroughly.\n*   **Engineering Controls:** Ensure adequate ventilation and the presence of safety showers and eyewash stations near workstations.\n*   **Storage:** Store ammonia in a dry, cool, well-ventilated area away from incompatible materials (oxidizers and yellow metals like brass and copper), direct sunlight, and ignition sources. Keep containers tightly closed and sealed until ready for use. Store cylinders upright and secured.\n*   **Accidental Release:** Accidental releases pose a serious fire or explosion hazard. Do not take action involving personal risk without proper training. Evacuate surrounding areas and keep unprotected personnel away. Shut off ignition sources.  Collect any spillage.\n*   **Transportation:** Always transport ammonia in closed, upright, and secure containers. Ensure those transporting the product know how to handle accidents or spillages.  Follow relevant transportation regulations (e.g., MARPOL Annex II, IBC Code).\n\n## Emergency Procedures\n\n*   **Eye Contact:** Immediately flush eyes with plenty of water for at least 10 minutes, lifting upper and lower eyelids. Seek medical attention.\n*   **Inhalation:** Remove the person to fresh air and ensure comfortable breathing. Immediately call a poison center or physician.\n*   **Skin Contact:** Remove contaminated clothing and rinse skin with water or shower. Seek medical attention.\n*   **Ingestion:** Do NOT induce vomiting. Immediately call a poison center or physician. Rinse the mouth.\n\n## Additional Notes\n\n*   Ammonia is a flammable gas and can form explosive mixtures with air.  Avoid release to the environment.\n*   Avoid breathing ammonia gas. \n*   Follow all safety data sheet instructions carefully.\n*   Disposal of ammonia and byproducts must comply with environmental protection and waste disposal legislation.",

          "content": "## Safety Measures for Handling Ammonia\n\nHandling ammonia requires strict adherence to safety protocols to prevent accidents and health hazards.  Here's a summary based on the provided document:\n\n**Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):**\n\n*   Always wear appropriate PPE, including chemical-resistant gloves, eye/face protection (safety goggles or face shield), and protective clothing (long sleeves, etc.).  The specific PPE will depend on the task and risk assessment.\n*   Appropriate footwear should also be worn, and any additional skin protection should be approved by a specialist.\n*   Based on the hazard and potential for exposure, select a respirator that meets the appropriate standards.\n\n**Handling Procedures:**\n\n*   Work only outdoors or in a well-ventilated area. Avoid breathing the gas.\n*   Thoroughly wash hands, forearms, and face after handling ammonia, before eating, smoking, or using the restroom, and at the end of the workday.\n*   Use only compatible equipment and materials.\n*   Keep containers upright and securely fastened.\n*   Use backflow preventative devices in the piping.\n*   Close the valve after each use and before disconnecting.\n*   Approach suspected leak areas with caution.\n*   Ensure proper ventilation and eliminate all ignition sources.\n*   Store ammonia in a dry, cool, and well-ventilated area away from incompatible materials (oxidizers and yellow metals like brass and copper) and direct sunlight.  Keep containers tightly closed and sealed.\n*   Cylinder temperatures should not exceed 52\u00b0C (125\u00b0F).\n\n**Emergency Procedures:**\n\n*   In case of accidental release, evacuate the surrounding area and keep personnel away unless properly trained.  Accidental releases pose a serious fire or explosion hazard.\n*   If inhaled, remove the person to fresh air and ensure comfortable breathing. Immediately call a poison center or physician.\n*   If swallowed, call a poison center or physician immediately.  Do NOT induce vomiting. Rinse the mouth.\n*   If ammonia contacts the skin or hair, immediately remove all contaminated clothing. Rinse the skin with water or shower.\n*   If ammonia contacts the eyes, immediately flush with plenty of water, occasionally lifting the upper and lower eyelids. Continue rinsing for at least 10 minutes. Seek immediate medical attention.\n*   For frostbite, try to warm up the frozen tissues and seek medical attention.\n\n**Storage:**\n\n*   Store ammonia in a dry, cool, well-ventilated area, away from incompatibles, direct sunlight, and ignition sources. Store locked up.  Cylinders should be stored upright with valve protection caps in place and firmly secured to prevent falling or being knocked over.\n\n**Disposal:**\n\n*   Disposal of ammonia, solutions, and byproducts must comply with environmental protection and waste disposal legislation and any regional or local authority requirements. Dispose of surplus and non-recyclable products through an approved waste disposal service.\n",
