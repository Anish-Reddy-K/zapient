Store locked up. Eliminate all ignition sources.\nKeep container tightly closed and sealed until ready for use. Cylinders should be stored\nupright, with valve protection cap in place, and firmly secured to prevent falling or being\nknocked over. Cylinder temperatures should not exceed 52 °C (125 °F).\nRefer to ANSI/CGA G-2.1, Section 5.13 for electrical classification of anhydrous\nammonia storage and handling areas. Where anhydrous ammonia is stored indoors,\nuse electrical (ventilating, lighting and material handling) equipment with the appropriate\nelectrical classification rating and use only non-sparking tools.\nDate of issue/Date of revision :1/10/2019 Date of previous issue :10/9/2018 Version :1.09 4/12",

Use process enclosures, local exhaust ventilation or\ncontrols other engineering controls to keep worker exposure to airborne contaminants below any\nrecommended or statutory limits. The engineering controls also need to keep gas,\nvapor or dust concentrations below any lower explosive limits. Use explosion-proof\nventilation equipment.\nEnvironmental exposure : Emissions from ventilation or work process equipment should be checked to ensure\ncontrols they comply with the requirements of environmental protection legislation. In some\ncases, fume scrubbers, filters or engineering modifications to the process equipment\nwill be necessary to reduce emissions to acceptable levels.\nIndividual protection measures\nHygiene measures : Wash hands, forearms and face thoroughly after handling chemical products, before\neating, smoking and using the lavatory and at the end of the working period.\nAppropriate techniques should be used to remove potentially contaminated clothing.\nWash contaminated clothing before reusing. Ensure that eyewash stations and safety\nshowers are close to the workstation location.\nEye/face protection : Safety eyewear complying with an approved standard should be used when a risk\nassessment indicates this is necessary to avoid exposure to liquid splashes, mists,\ngases or dusts. If contact is possible, the following protection should be worn, unless\nthe assessment indicates a higher degree of protection: chemical splash goggles and/\nor face shield. If inhalation hazards exist, a full-face respirator may be required instead.\nSkin protection\nHand protection : Chemical-resistant, impervious gloves complying with an approved standard should be\nworn at all times when handling chemical products if a risk assessment indicates this is\nnecessary. Considering the parameters specified by the glove manufacturer, check\nduring use that the gloves are still retaining their protective properties. It should be\nnoted that the time to breakthrough for any glove material may be different for different\nglove manufacturers. In the case of mixtures, consisting of several substances, the\nprotection time of the gloves cannot be accurately estimated.\nBody protection : Personal protective equipment for the body should be selected based on the task being\nperformed and the risks involved and should be approved by a specialist before\nhandling this product. When there is a risk of ignition from static electricity, wear anti-\nstatic protective clothing. For the greatest protection from static discharges, clothing\nshould include anti-static overalls, boots and gloves.\nDate of issue/Date of revision :1/10/2019 Date of previous issue :10/9/2018 Version :1.09 5/12",
