Remove from exposure, lie down.\nIn case of accident or if you feel unwell, seek medical advice immediately. When\nsymptoms persist or in all cases of doubt, seek medical advice. Never give anything by\nmouth to an unconscious person. Take off all contaminated clothing immediately and\nthoroughly wash material from skin. Immediate medical attention is required.\nInhalation Aspiration into lungs can produce severe lung damage. If breathing has stopped, give\nartificial respiration. Get medical attention immediately. Remove to fresh air. Avoid direct\ncontact with skin. Use barrier to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. If breathing is difficult,\n(trained personnel should) give oxygen. Get immediate medical advice/attention. Delayed\npulmonary edema may occur.\nEye contact Rinse immediately with plenty of water, also under the eyelids, for at least 15 minutes. Keep\neye wide open while rinsing. Do not rub affected area. Remove contact lenses, if present\nand easy to do. Continue rinsing. Get medical attention if irritation develops and persists.\nSkin contact Wash off immediately with soap and plenty of water while removing all contaminated\nclothes and shoes. Get medical attention if irritation develops and persists.\nIngestion Do NOT induce vomiting. Clean mouth with water and drink afterwards plenty of water.\nNever give anything by mouth to an unconscious person. ASPIRATION HAZARD IF\nSWALLOWED - CAN ENTER LUNGS AND CAUSE DAMAGE. If vomiting occurs\nspontaneously, keep head below hips to prevent aspiration. Get immediate medical\nadvice/attention.\nSelf-protection of the first aider Remove all sources of ignition. Ensure that medical personnel are aware of the material(s)\ninvolved, take precautions to protect themselves and prevent spread of contamination. Use\npersonal protective equipment as required. See section 8 for more information. Avoid direct\ncontact with skin. Use barrier to give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Avoid contact with skin,\neyes or clothing. Wear personal protective clothing (see section 8).\nMost important symptoms and effects, both acute and delayed\nSymptoms Difficulty in breathing. Coughing and/ or wheezing. Dizziness. Burning sensation.\nIndication of any immediate medical attention and special treatment needed\nNote to physicians Because of the danger of aspiration, emesis or gastric lavage should not be employed\nunless the risk is justified by the presence of additional toxic substances.\n5. FIRE-FIGHTING MEASURES\nSuitable Extinguishing Media Dry chemical. Carbon dioxide (CO2). Water spray. Alcohol resistant foam.\nSmall Fire Any extinguisher suitable for Class B fires, dry chemical, CO2, foam (AFFF/ATC), or water\nspray can be used.\nLarge Fire Water spray, fog or alcohol-resistant foam. CAUTION: Use of water spray when fighting fire\nmay be inefficient. Cool containers with flooding quantities of water until well after fire is out.\nUnsuitable extinguishing media CAUTION: Use of water spray when fighting fire may be inefficient.\nSpecific hazards arising from the Risk of ignition. Keep product and empty container away from heat and sources of ignition.\nchemical In the event of fire, cool tanks with water spray. Fire residues and contaminated fire\nextinguishing water must be disposed of in accordance with local regulations.\nHazardous combustion products Smoke, CO, and other products of incomplete combustion.\n_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n888100004765 Benzene Page 3 / 11",

The most characteristic\nsystemic effect resulting from high enough intermediate and chronic benzene exposure is\narrested development of blood cells. Studies have linked overexposure to benzene to many\nhematological effects including aplastic anemia, pancytopenia, leukopenia, and\nmyelodysplastic syndrome. In vivo and in vitro data from both humans and animals show\nthat benzene and/or its metabolites are genotoxic. Studies in animals provide supporting\nevidence for the carcinogenicity of inhaled benzene. Epidemiological studies have reported\na causal relationship between occupational benzene exposures and acute myelogenous\nleukemia. Some studies suggest associations between benzene exposure and\nnon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and other cancers. Benzene has been\nclassified as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1) by IARC, and the ECHA C&L Inventory\nstates it may cause cancer (Carc. 1B). IARC concluded that benzene causes acute myeloid\nleukemia and a positive association has been observed for acute lymphatic leukemia,\nchronic lymphatic leukemia, non-hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. Human studies\nsuggest that female fertility and menstrual cycles were effected by benzene exposure;\nhowever, due to uncertainties in exposure and limited data the studies were considered\ninconclusive. Developmental effects have been observed in animals including persistent\nhematopoietic anomalies. It has been suggested that the reported benzene fetotoxicity of\ndecreased weight and skeletal variants is a function of maternal toxicity.\nHealth hazard and classification information\nSkin Corrosion/Irritation Category Classification based on data available for ingredients.
