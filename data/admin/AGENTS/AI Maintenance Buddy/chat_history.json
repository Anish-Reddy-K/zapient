          "content": "## Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) for Ammonia and Benzene\n\nBoth ammonia and benzene handling require comprehensive PPE, but specifics vary.\n\n**Ammonia:**\n*   **Respiratory Protection:**  A respirator appropriate for the hazard and potential exposure is necessary, selected based on risk assessment.  A full-face respirator may be required in certain high-risk situations.\n*   **Skin Protection:** Chemical-resistant, impervious gloves are essential. Additional skin protection measures (footwear, body protection) should be chosen based on the task and risks, and approved by a specialist.\n*   **Eye Protection:** Safety goggles are required to protect the eyes from damage.\n\n**Benzene:**\n*   **Respiratory Protection:**  Specific respirators are not detailed in the provided text.\n*   **Skin Protection:** Impervious gloves are recommended.  Long-sleeved clothing and chemical-resistant clothing are also advised.\n*   **Eye Protection:** Tight-sealing safety goggles are recommended.\n\n**Similarities:**\n*   Both require eye protection (goggles).\n*   Both require hand protection (gloves).\n*   Both emphasize selecting appropriate PPE based on risk assessment and task, potentially requiring specialist approval.\n\n**Differences:**\n*   Ammonia specifies the need for respirators, detailing scenarios where full-face respirators might be necessary. Benzene does not specify respirator types.\n*   Ammonia provides more detail on skin protection, mentioning the need for specialist approval for additional measures. Benzene's skin protection recommendations are more general.",
